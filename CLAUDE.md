# Lightweight mesh preprocessing application

The PLAN.md file includes a list of objectives I wish to implement.
Each task should be performed on a separate branch.
Before creating a new branch, ensure that all changes on `main` have been pulled.

After implementing changes as outlined in the PLAN.md file, always review the PLAN.md contents and check off items that have been completed.

Do not create summary markdown files after a task has been completed unless otherwise instructed.
